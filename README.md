# Cyber Lab Projects

This repository showcases hands-on cybersecurity projects I built to demonstrate skills in **network traffic analysis, log inspection, and SIEM dashboards**.  

## ðŸ”¹ Projects

### 1. Python Sniffer (`sniffer_2.0.py`)
A custom Python script for packet sniffing.  
- Captures live network traffic  
- Displays source/destination IPs, ports, and packet details  
- Demonstrates socket programming and low-level packet parsing

### 2. Wireshark Analysis
Practical lab using Wireshark for network traffic analysis.  
- Applied filters for DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, and TCP traffic  
- Identified suspicious activity in packet captures  
- Demonstrated hands-on analysis for SOC environments
