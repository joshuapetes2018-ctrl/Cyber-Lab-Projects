# Cyber-Lab-Projects
A collection of cybersecurity projects including a custom Python sniffer, Wireshark analysis, and Splunk dashboarding for log analysis and SIEM visualization

## Files in this Repository

1. **sniffer 2.0.py**  
   - A custom Python script for sniffing network packets.  
   - Captures live traffic and displays packet details in the console.  
   - Demonstrates coding skills and understanding of network protocols.

2. **portfolio_capture.pcap**  
   - A clean Wireshark capture focused on HTTP/HTTPS traffic.  
   - Small and easy to analyze for educational purposes.  
   - Open in Wireshark to explore protocols, source/destination IPs, and packet headers.

3. **internal_Log_Test_Dashboard.xml**  
   - A dashboard for visualizing logs and traffic patterns.  
   - Shows ability to structure and analyze captured data visually.

## How to Use

1. **Wireshark Capture:**  
   - Open `portfolio_capture.pcap` in Wireshark.  
   - Apply filters or inspect individual packets to analyze traffic.

2. **Python Sniffer:**  
   - Run `sniffer 2.0.py` in a Python environment.  
   - Captures and displays live packets in real time.

3. **Dashboard:**  
   - Load `internal_Log_Test_Dashboard.xml` in a dashboard tool (Splunk, Kibana, or XML-compatible viewers).  
   - Review and interpret visualized traffic data.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Network traffic capture and analysis with Wireshark  
- Python scripting for packet sniffing  
- Log analysis and dashboard creation  
- Filtering and exporting packet captures  
- Professional project documentation

## Notes

- All captures are filtered to exclude sensitive data.  
- Screenshots can be added for additional proof of work.

## Next Steps (Optional)

To make this portfolio stand out even more:
- Add a `screenshots/` folder with 3â€“5 images of Wireshark, filters, and your dashboard.
- Update this README to include the screenshots.
- Include brief bullet-point highlights of what a recruiter or hiring manager should notice.
